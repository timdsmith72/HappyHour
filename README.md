# Use to pick something at random.

There are so many places here that we want to try, we never could pick one.  So I wrote an app to pick one for us!
It can be used for anything really, but we use it for Happy Hour places. Hence the name.

You input the list of things you want to randomly pick from and hit the button.  It shuffles the array and displays to you the random element it picked.  
That's it!  That's all it does.
